## 🌹 Runs N' Poses 🌹 - protein-ligand co-folding prediction dataset and benchmark

This repository accompanies the pre-print: ["Have protein-ligand co-folding methods moved beyond memorisation?"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309)

This benchmark tests the ability of protein-ligand co-folding methods to generalize to systems different from those in their training set.
This is a zero-shot benchmark, provided that your method uses a structural training cutoff of 30 September 2021.

Find ML-ready versions of the [dataset](https://polarishub.io/datasets/plinder-org/runs-n-poses-dataset) and [benchmark](https://polarishub.io/benchmarks/plinder-org/runs-n-poses) at [Polaris](https://polarishub.io/).

## Installation

⚠️ **Note**: The original `conda env create -f environment.yaml` command fails due to dependency conflicts between `openstructure`, `boost`, and `rdkit`. Use the step-by-step instructions below instead.

### Option 1: Step-by-step installation (recommended)

```sh
# 1. Create base environment
conda create -n runs_n_poses python=3.10 -c conda-forge -y
conda activate runs_n_poses

# 2. Install openstructure first (from aivant channel)
conda install -c conda-forge -c aivant openstructure=2.8.0 -y

# 3. Install rdkit via pip (conda version conflicts with openstructure's boost)
pip install rdkit

# 4. Install remaining dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge pandas ipykernel jupyter scikit-learn cmap matplotlib seaborn pyyaml reduce -y
pip install plinder
```

### Option 2: Use pre-solved environment

```sh
conda env create -f environment.working.yaml
conda activate runs_n_poses
```

    "ccd_codes": ["VFU", "MES", "NDP"]
  }
}
```

### `ground_truth.tar.gz`

```text
ground_truth/
    <system_id>/
        ligand_files/ # SDF files of each ligand chain in the system
            <chain_id_1>.sdf
            <chain_id_2>.sdf
            ...
        receptor.cif # Receptor structure in CIF format
        sequences.fasta # FASTA file for the receptor sequences
        system.cif # System (receptors + ligands) structure in CIF format
    ...
```

### `msa_files.tar.gz`

Contains the MSA files for each system in the same fashion as seen in `examples/inputs/msa_files`.

### `all_similarity_scores.parquet`

Contains all calculated similarity metrics for Runs N' Poses dataset systems against the entire PDB up until 5 January 2025. This was used to get the closest training systems up to 30 September 2021 based on SuCOS-pocket similarity (`sucos_shape_pocket_qcov`).

Here is how you can obtain the systems to use and corresponding similarity scores for a different training cutoff, with the example of the 1 June 2023 cutoff used by Boltz-2:

```python
similarity_df_boltz2 = all_similarity_scores[all_similarity_scores["target_release_date"] < boltz_training_cutoff].sort_values(by="sucos_shape_pocket_qcov", ascending=False).groupby("group_key").head(1).reset_index(drop=True)
usable_systems = set(annotated_df[annotated_df["release_date"] > boltz_training_cutoff]["system_id"])
similarity_2023 = dict(zip(similarity_df_boltz2["group_key"], similarity_df_boltz2["sucos_shape_pocket_qcov"]))
annotated_df["sucos_shape_pocket_qcov_2023"] = annotated_df["group_key"].map(similarity_2023)
```

And here's how you can calculate the closest training system using a different similarity score than SuCOS-pocket similarity, with the example of using just pocket coverage:

```python
pocket_qcov_best = all_similarity_scores[all_similarity_scores["target_release_date"] < training_cutoff].sort_values(by="pocket_qcov", ascending=False).groupby("group_key").head(1).reset_index(drop=True)
pocket_qcov_best = dict(zip(pocket_qcov_best["group_key"], pocket_qcov_best["pocket_qcov"]))
annotated_df["pocket_qcov_best"] = annotated_df["group_key"].map(pocket_qcov_best)
```

## Reproducing Figures

See `figures.ipynb` for the code used to generate the figures in the paper. This requires `plotting.py`, `all_similarity_scores.parquet`, `annotations.csv` and extracted `predictions.tar.gz`, `posebusters_results.tar.gz`.

## Running Predictions

See `input_preparation.ipynb` for instructions on how to prepare the input for the four benchmarked methods. This requires `inputs.json`. See the `examples/inputs` folder for an example of an input file for each method. See `examples/utils` for example commands to run predictions with each benchmarked method. To execute those command please follow instructions on their github pages.

## Extracting Accuracy Metrics

See the `examples/utils`, `examples/analysis` and `extract_scores.ipynb` for instructions on how to run accuracy scoring and extract relevant accuracy metrics for each method. This requires `ground_truth.tar.gz`, `inputs.json` and `annotations.csv`.

**NOTE**: This requires a version of the Chemical Components Dictionary prepared for OpenStructure and exported as an environment variable, as follows (see [#6](https://github.com/plinder-org/runs-n-poses/issues/6)):
```sh
wget https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/components.cif.gz
chemdict_tool create components.cif.gz compounds.chemlib pdb -i
export OST_COMPOUNDS_CHEMLIB=compounds.chemlib
```

## Similarity scoring

See `similarity_scoring.py` for how we calculated the similarity metrics. This requires an entire copy of the PDB, the PLINDER dataset, and large amounts of memory. The same functionality will shortly be added to [PLINDER](https://github.com/plinder-org/plinder).
The processed output of this script can be found in `all_similarity_scores.parquet`.

## Dataset
All necesary dataset files are in the runs-n-poses-datasets folder

## PLAN: We need to run 2vinardo-mar5 (executable in path), and analyze the results
1- Use obabel-25-07 to first create pdbqt files for the receptor + any cofactors/metals joined into one file, prepare using -d (add hydrogens) and with -xc and -xr flags
2- Use obabel-25-07 to create pdbt files for the ligand explicited in the annotations.csv in the ligand_instance_chain column (run obabel-25-07 with -d but without -xc and -xr to prepare ligand)
3- Create a script that will run 2vinardo-mar5_autobox for each complex, adding the corresponding ligand as a flag with --ligand and receptor with --receptor (the pdbt files created in step 1 and 2), and also with --config config.fijo
4- Write a script that uses the runs-n-poses tools to analyze the results and output them in the same format as the files in the predictions folder, lets call it vinardock_2vinardo.
5- Write a script to reproduce Figure 1 Panel E, from the "Have protein-ligand cofolding methods moved
beyond memorisation?" paper, but adding vinardock results columns.

**Implementation**: All 5 steps are implemented as Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory. See `scripts/README.md` for usage instructions.

## Conda Environment Troubleshooting

The original `environment.yaml` had unsolvable conflicts between `openstructure`, `boost`, and `rdkit` in conda's solver. **This is now fixed.** The `environment.yaml` file has been updated with step-by-step installation instructions, and a pre-solved `environment.working.yaml` is also provided. See the [Installation](#installation) section above.

## Single ligand benchmark
We will run on the 1426 systems with a single ligand.
